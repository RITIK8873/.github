# Oops! You Forgot to Change the Placeholder

ðŸ˜„ Well, this is awkward! It seems the user who sent you here forgot to change the placeholder URL. So, instead of finding what you were looking for, you've landed on my profile. 

ðŸ˜… Well, you are not alone!  ![Profile Views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=your-github-profile&color=blue)

But hey, mistakes happen, right? Here's a gentle reminder for the user:

### Dear User,

Next time, remember to update your placeholder URL. It's a simple step that saves everyone a bit of confusion. ðŸ˜‰
